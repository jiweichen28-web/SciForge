# @sciforge/multi-agent

Shared child-run contract, file store, and supervised runtime for SciForge AgentRuntime integrations.

The package does not call model providers and does not store provider credentials.
`AgentRuntimeHost` injects a `ChildRunExecutor` backed by the selected adapter's
provider-neutral `spawn/resume/inspect/message/cancel/delete` contract. Provider protocol and
credentials remain inside that adapter.

Hosts that expose delegation to a model should provide one batch-capable
delegation contract. Independent child tasks submitted in the same request start
concurrently up to `maxParallel`; the runtime admits starts atomically so active
children cannot exceed that configured capacity. A parent turn has no separate
lifetime child-run quota: after children finish, the parent may delegate more
work in the same turn.

The Host registers one `MultiAgentLifecycleControl` before provider spawn and
the adapter reports `missing` until its child channel is active. Once the
provider creates a real thread, the executor persists it through `setThreadRef`
so running children can be opened immediately. Child work has no wall-clock
completion deadline. Callers receive a stable child ID immediately and can
inspect liveness, wait for a bounded observation window, send guidance, or
explicitly cancel the child. An observation timeout or a failed liveness probe
never changes the child to a terminal state. Parent cancellation uses the same
canonical termination control. Failed or aborted children can resume with the
same stable child ID and provider thread context; each continuation increments
the persisted attempt counter. Permanent deletion first settles active work,
then removes both provider and canonical store state and emits a delete refresh
event so historical lifecycle events cannot repopulate the child sidebar.

The child-run store is the canonical lifecycle state. `child_event` callbacks
are best-effort refresh notifications, so notification delivery failures never
change or interrupt a persisted child run. A new runtime instance persistently
recovers stale `queued` or `running` records as `aborted` before accepting tool
operations; it preserves their prompts, transcripts, usage, request identities,
and provider thread references for audit instead of deleting or replaying them.
