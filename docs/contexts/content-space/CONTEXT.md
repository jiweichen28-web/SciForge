# Content Space

> Current-state audit: 2026-08-18. Provider-neutral Content Space V1, portable codecs/resolution, Principal-aware routing, mock Provider, and UI are implemented. OpenContent Change 1 may admit only its reviewed development profile while production remains blocked.

Content Space is the SciForge bounded context for provider-hosted directories, ordinary files, and fixed provider-backed artifacts. It is separate from live collaborative documents and from the SciForge Workspace filesystem.

## Language

**Content Space**:
The provider-neutral SciForge capability for selecting provider-backed space, navigating directories, transferring ordinary files, and producing fixed resource references.
_Avoid_: Shared Documents, Workspace, Project state store, OpenContent drive

**ContentSpaceProvider**:
The Content Space-owned Provider Contract for container discovery, directory navigation, ordinary-file transfer, version observation, and portal targets.
_Avoid_: universal Provider, DocumentProvider, storage SDK

**Content Space Provider Integration**:
A Provider Integration that implements ContentSpaceProvider for one Provider Kind without becoming part of the Content Space domain language.
_Avoid_: Content Space fork, Host storage backend, provider-specific UI

**Content Container**:
A provider-owned space, library, or directory selected as an explicit target for ordinary-file operations.
_Avoid_: Content Space bounded context, Workspace directory, Project

**Content Container Scope**:
The provider-neutral classification `personal` or `shared` describing whether a Content Container is private to the enrolled External Account or eligible for an explicit multi-user association. Scope is descriptive and never substitutes for Provider authorization.
_Avoid_: OpenContent Team type, Project membership, ACL

**Content Container Reference**:
A non-secret typed reference to a Content Container, containing only a Provider Instance Reference and stable provider container identity. Cloud Collaboration may own a Project Content Space Binding to it; Content Space does not own Project state.
_Avoid_: endpoint, path as authority, local connection, Project ID

**Project Content Directory**:
A shared Content Container dedicated to one Collaboration Project and selected by its Project Owner. It remains Provider-owned, cannot be bound to a second Project, and is never deleted as a consequence of Project archival or deletion.
_Avoid_: Collaboration Project, OpenContent Team root, Workspace, synchronized folder

**Content File Reference**:
A live reference to an ordinary provider file without a guarantee that its current version is immutable. A PoC upload result remains a Content File Reference or artifact candidate until the provider's immutable-version contract is proven.
_Avoid_: fixed Artifact Reference, Shared Document, Workspace file

**Artifact Reference**:
A fixed provider-backed result identity containing a Provider Instance Reference, provider resource identity, and provider-guaranteed immutable version identity, with an optional non-content digest. It may be issued only when version immutability, retention, and version-specific retrieval are formally supported.
_Avoid_: current file ID only, live Document Reference, mutable latest version

**Task Artifact**:
An ordinary provider-backed file associated with a task as a fixed result rather than an ongoing collaborative document. Its business association belongs to the consuming task or record context, while its bytes remain in the provider.
_Avoid_: Shared Document, Document Reference Association, Workspace output mirror

**Task Artifact Association**:
A Cloud Collaboration association from a completed task result or record to an Artifact Reference. Content Space produces and resolves the reference but imports no Task or Project type.
_Avoid_: Content Space owns Task, live Document Reference as fixed output

**Display Label**:
A Human-approved non-authoritative label stored with a consuming association. It is not the current provider filename or path and is not refreshed after provider access becomes unavailable.
_Avoid_: authoritative provider metadata, ACL hint

**Content Space Capability Readiness**:
The state `poc_only`, `blocked_by_contract`, or `production_ready` for one operation. PoC-only execution requires a trusted instance/root/account/operation/audience policy and cannot be promoted by Agent, renderer, remote Task, portable input, or untrusted configuration.
_Avoid_: environment flag as production approval, partial means complete

**Agent Root Candidate**:
A bounded, non-authorizing projection of one trusted Provider Instance, `personal | shared` scope, Human-visible `libraryLabel`, and optional opaque page cursor. It lets a Personal Session ask the Human to select an exact root without exposing or accepting a Provider folder identity, and it never substitutes for confirmed root authorization.
_Avoid_: Content Container Reference, Provider Instance display label, folder ID/GUID, Team ID, authorization cache

**Agent Content Space Scope**:
The Content Space authority available to an Agent execution context. A Personal Session obtains an installed Provider Instance from native Broker discovery and supplies `personal | shared` scope. If the Human has not supplied an exact library label, the Agent may page through label-only Agent Root Candidates; zero or multiple distinct choices require Human clarification and are never guessed, while canonically duplicate labels remain unavailable until the Provider-side ambiguity is resolved. Root authorization remains separately confirmed and resolves exactly one live match from the complete current container listing while rejecting raw Provider folder identities. Host then issues only a bounded caller/Principal/Workspace-bound Broker resource, and descendants arise only by listing an authorized directory. A Project Task uses only its Project Content Directory and descendants even when the executing owner's Provider ACL is broader.
_Avoid_: all resources visible to the Token, task-supplied connection, Project-wide Provider account

**Workspace Content Transfer**:
One explicit, approved upload from or download to the current execution context's authorized Workspace using a one-shot Host grant. It creates no synchronization, mirror, mount, ownership transfer, or cascading deletion relationship.
_Avoid_: Content Space sync, Workspace projection, provider mount

**Provider Content Authority**:
The rule that the provider remains the sole source of stored file bytes, versions, directory state, and access control. SciForge keeps typed references and necessary status, not a second provider file store.
_Avoid_: Workspace mirror, SciForge ACL shadow, bidirectional file sync
