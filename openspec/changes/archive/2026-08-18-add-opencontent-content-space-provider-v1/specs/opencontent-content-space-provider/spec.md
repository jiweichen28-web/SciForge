## Purpose

Defines the OpenContent ContentSpaceProvider mapping for bound-account personal/team libraries and the exact Change 1 Human/Agent file-operation boundary.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Adapter is independently composed and lazy

`opencontent-content-space-provider` SHALL be an optional trusted compile-time main-only package with exactly one generic extension at `main.content-space-provider-factory` for Provider Kind `opencontent`. It SHALL acquire only its Host-issued token-free Connector facade and SHALL register no renderer, public OpenContent capability, IPC/MCP, credential store, raw client, portable resolver, or DocumentProvider. Construction SHALL perform no login, credential, network, content, or mutation work.

#### Scenario: Adapter is absent

- **WHEN** the package is omitted
- **THEN** generic Content Space, its UI, mock/other Providers, and the source-development application SHALL continue without fallback

### Requirement: Personal and Team libraries map to provider-neutral containers

The bound account's personal root SHALL map to one `ContentContainerSummary` with `scope: personal`. Each accessible OpenContent Team root SHALL map to a summary with `scope: shared`. Stable folder identity, preferably `folderGuid`, SHALL form the portable `containerId`; numeric folder IDs and Team DTOs SHALL remain integration-private. Team and Project SHALL NOT be treated as the same aggregate or identity.

#### Scenario: Team display name changes

- **WHEN** the Provider returns the same stable root identity with a different safe label
- **THEN** the reference SHALL remain stable and only display metadata SHALL change

### Requirement: One canonical Content Space path serves Human and Agent audiences

Renderer and Agent callers SHALL converge on the same Content Space service → pinned Provider path. Human operations SHALL use Human-only global capabilities and Host-selected file handles. Agent content operations SHALL use Agent-only Broker resource capabilities after a confirmed root authorization; an Agent SHALL NOT invoke the Human global content capabilities. The adapter SHALL use only the executing node owner's current Principal-bound connection. Callers SHALL NOT supply a connection, external account, endpoint, coordinator/admin credential, or alternate Provider.

Provider-neutral discovery metadata SHALL make external personal/Team library browse, folder, upload, and download intents discoverable as native Content Space operations even when the prompt also contains an installed Provider's display name. Generic runtime guidance SHALL search the native capability family before substituting an unrelated managed Provider; the Host SHALL NOT hard-code an OpenContent switch or expose Provider credentials to discovery.

#### Scenario: Requester supplies an account hint

- **WHEN** a Task, prompt, portable reference, or capability payload attempts to select an OpenContent account
- **THEN** the hint SHALL be rejected or ignored as invalid contract input before provider access

#### Scenario: Prompt names an installed content Provider and Team library

- **WHEN** a Personal Session asks to browse or upload to a named external Team library
- **THEN** native discovery SHALL return the provider-neutral root-authorization operation without requiring a Provider-specific Agent tool or managed-storage fallback

### Requirement: Agent resource scope is explicit and descendant-bounded

A Personal Session Agent SHALL first obtain Human confirmation for one exact personal or Team root that the bound account can currently enumerate. The authorization request SHALL contain only the selected Provider Instance, provider-neutral scope, and Human-visible library label; it SHALL NOT accept a Provider folder ID/GUID. After confirmation, Host SHALL enumerate that Provider Instance through the canonical Content Space service and SHALL authorize only one exact canonical-label-and-scope match. Zero or multiple matches SHALL fail without issuing a resource. Host SHALL issue a bounded opaque resource tied to the exact Agent caller, Principal, and Workspace context. Children SHALL become reachable only when listing an already-authorized directory issues descendant resources; raw references SHALL NOT widen scope. A Project Task Agent, after Change 2 provides a binding, SHALL not use ad-hoc root authorization and SHALL access only the current Project Content Directory and descendants. Scope checks and OpenContent ACL SHALL both pass; Project membership SHALL never substitute for Provider permission.

#### Scenario: Human names one currently enumerable Team root

- **WHEN** the request selects a Provider Instance, `shared` scope, and a Team label that has exactly one canonical match in the current bound account's paginated container listing
- **THEN** confirmation SHALL authorize that exact stable root and return only its caller-bound Broker resource authority

#### Scenario: Team label is missing or ambiguous

- **WHEN** the current listing contains zero or multiple canonical matches for the requested label and scope
- **THEN** Content Space SHALL reject the selection and SHALL NOT guess, probe a raw identity, or issue any Agent resource

#### Scenario: Bound account can access a sibling Team directory

- **WHEN** a Project Task requests that sibling outside its bound directory
- **THEN** Content Space SHALL deny the request before the adapter performs the content operation

#### Scenario: Agent submits a raw Team folder GUID

- **WHEN** no confirmed root or descendant Broker resource authorizes that folder
- **THEN** Agent content capabilities SHALL reject it without resolving or probing the raw folder reference

### Requirement: Change 1 operation set and ACL behavior are strict

The adapter SHALL implement only list containers, browse directory entries, create folder, upload-new up to 16 MiB, and download up to 1 GiB. OpenContent ACL SHALL be the permission authority. Unauthorized, unavailable, rate-limited, and malformed Provider responses SHALL remain distinct bounded provider-neutral outcomes with no raw response content. Unauthorized SHALL include Human guidance to obtain permission in OpenContent. The adapter SHALL NOT create accounts, invite members, change ACLs, borrow credentials, overwrite/update, auto-rename, move, delete, share, synchronize, or fall back.

#### Scenario: Project member lacks OpenContent permission

- **WHEN** the Provider denies the executing owner's account
- **THEN** SciForge SHALL return unauthorized and SHALL NOT use the Project Owner, Coordinator, administrator, or another member's connection

#### Scenario: OpenContent throttles or violates its pinned response schema

- **WHEN** the Connector reports rate limiting or a malformed response contract
- **THEN** the adapter SHALL preserve the bounded typed outcome and SHALL NOT expose Provider diagnostics, DTOs, endpoints, credentials, or numeric handles

### Requirement: Agent transfer bytes cross only approved Workspace grants

Agent upload SHALL accept only a Workspace-relative path in the current execution context's authorized Workspace. After Human confirmation, Host SHALL validate real-path containment, regular-file type, symlink escape, size, and access before issuing a one-shot upload handle. Agent download SHALL accept only a new Workspace-relative destination; Host SHALL reject existing targets, write a temporary file, validate bounds/completion, and atomically commit. Arbitrary filesystem paths and bearer/region URLs SHALL never enter renderer, Agent, or Provider business input.

#### Scenario: Download destination already exists or escapes by symlink

- **WHEN** Host validates the requested relative destination
- **THEN** it SHALL reject before provider transfer and SHALL NOT overwrite or write outside the authorized Workspace

### Requirement: Writes preserve conflict, cancellation, and uncertainty

Create-folder/upload-new SHALL use the exact explicit parent and name and SHALL never overwrite, auto-rename, retarget, retry blindly, or fall back. Collision SHALL map to typed conflict. Timeout, cancellation, session supersession, or ambiguous receipt after a write may have committed SHALL map to `outcome_unknown` and SHALL NOT retry.

#### Scenario: Upload response is ambiguous

- **WHEN** exact single creation cannot be proven
- **THEN** the adapter SHALL return `outcome_unknown` and SHALL not upload again

### Requirement: Development readiness is trusted and operation-specific

Only a trusted compile-time development profile MAY admit the reviewed shared demonstration Provider Instance, least-privilege account class, exact operation, transfer limit, and UI/Agent audience. Caller input, environment text, a successful sibling operation, or portable identity SHALL NOT widen readiness. Production remains blocked pending a separate decision.

#### Scenario: Listing is proven but upload schema is not

- **WHEN** the UI or Agent requests upload
- **THEN** upload SHALL remain `blocked_by_contract` even though listing succeeds

### Requirement: Project binding, Shared Documents, and artifacts remain separate

This adapter SHALL NOT own ProjectContentSpaceBinding, Project lifecycle, Team membership, Shared Documents, collaborative editing, or ArtifactReference issuance without immutable-version proof. Project archival/deletion SHALL never trigger Provider deletion.

#### Scenario: Change 1 completes before Change 2

- **WHEN** no Project binding contract is installed
- **THEN** existing-account binding and personal/team file operations SHALL remain complete without Project special cases
