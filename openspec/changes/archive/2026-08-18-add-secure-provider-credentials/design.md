## Context

`DomainMainHost` already exposes owner-scoped `packageSecrets`, and generated composition derives each installed package owner before issuing that facade. The Host persists encrypted package records through Electron `safeStorage`, atomically replaces the encrypted file, and fails when OS encryption is unavailable. This is the canonical storage primitive, but its current key/value API lacks provider-specific binding, assurance, bounded-use, rotation/redaction, and source-platform acceptance semantics. ADR 0006 requires those guarantees. ADR-0026 further establishes that `local-selection` may scope a separately authenticated external Provider Connection without becoming proof of the external identity.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**

- Harden the existing provider-neutral package-storage boundary instead of adding another secret path.
- Bind owner identity and current Human Principal outside package-controlled input.
- Make lifecycle and failure behavior testable through the real Electron source-development path and automated platform-policy tests.
- Keep secret values out of every public or durable application surface.

**Non-Goals:**

- Defining OpenContent login, Token refresh, logout, or revocation semantics.
- Creating a renderer credential form or Agent capability.
- Treating Local Account selection as authenticated external identity; it only owns the separately authenticated node-local connection.
- Adding a general-purpose password vault or shared cross-node credential service.

## Decisions

### Reuse the existing per-entry Host facade

Generated main composition already derives installed package identity and supplies owner-bound `packageSecrets`. This change SHALL preserve that canonical path and add only the exact binding and bounded-use semantics required for provider credentials. Package code never passes a namespace string, and no second storage root, vault, provider-specific IPC, or Host OpenContent branch is introduced.

Alternative rejected: accept `ownerId` on every call. A trusted package could then impersonate another integration accidentally or deliberately.

Alternative rejected: keep `packageSecrets` and introduce a separate secure-provider vault. Two stores would create ambiguous rotation, deletion, redaction, and restart behavior.

### Keep non-secret metadata outside secure records

Connection labels, state, instance reference, and local connection ID live in the owning integration's non-secret store. The OS record contains only versioned secret material and binding identifiers needed to detect mismatches. This avoids turning OS storage into a searchable connection database.

Alternative rejected: store the entire Provider Connection object as one opaque secret. It would make migration, diagnostics, and strict public projections harder while obscuring which fields need confidentiality.

### Expose bounded secret use, not general retrieval

The facade provides owner-only operations that deliver the decrypted value inside a short main-process callback/lease and zeroize or release references promptly. Exact mechanics remain platform-specific behind the Host port.

Alternative rejected: return a long-lived string to package services. JavaScript cannot guarantee zeroization, but the Host can still minimize scope and prevent accidental transport through public APIs.

### Permit only provider-mandated private HTTPS query serialization

Some verified provider contracts, including the current OpenContent Token validation and transfer APIs, require the Token in the outbound HTTPS query. The owning Connector MAY construct that exact request URL only inside the bounded credential-use callback and immediately pass it to the network implementation. The Connector pins the permitted HTTPS origin/path, rejects redirects, omits referrer and ambient credentials, discards provider/network error text, and never returns or persists the credential-bearing URL. Managed redaction still treats active and recently retired values as sensitive in case infrastructure echoes the URL.

Alternative rejected: silently move the Token to a header or body. The current provider contract does not establish those transports and changing them would make the verified integration fail at runtime.

Alternative rejected: treat arbitrary URLs as credential transports. Renderer, Agent, capability, diagnostic, trace, Workspace, Project, Task, portable-reference, and cross-node surfaces remain forbidden, as do caller-controlled endpoints and redirects.

### Separate local deletion from provider revocation

This change guarantees atomic local deletion and reports secure-store outcomes. Provider logout/revocation attempts and their remote confirmation belong to the connector that understands the provider contract.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- **[OS secure-storage guarantees differ]** → Define an approved guarantee per supported OS and fail closed where it cannot be met.
- **[Generated composition currently shares one Host object]** → Introduce generic per-entry Host binding and architecture tests; do not special-case OpenContent.
- **[Secrets may survive in third-party error text]** → Register active/recent values with canonical redaction and use canary tests across logs/traces.
- **[Provider-mandated query Tokens may be observed outside SciForge]** → Limit the exception to pinned HTTPS requests inside the Connector, disable redirects/referrers, discard raw network/provider diagnostics, and keep production readiness separately gated.
- **[Provider policy and Principal assurance diverge]** → Make the accepted assurances an explicit trusted policy and require the connector to prove the external account independently.

## Migration Plan

1. Audit the existing `packageSecrets` contract, storage files, generated owner binding, encryption and callers.
2. Extend that canonical contract with exact provider-credential record bindings and bounded use.
3. Harden and verify supported OS behavior without insecure fallback or a second store.
4. Integrate the canonical redaction registry.
5. Enable no provider connection until its connector separately satisfies identity and authentication Gates.

## Source Development Acceptance Evidence

Status as of 2026-08-17:

| Platform/path | Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS arm64 source application | Real Electron `safeStorage`; four isolated launches verify store, restart/use, rotate, delete, and restart-absent | Verified |
| Windows/macOS/Linux backend admission | Automated platform-policy tests admit Electron OS encryption on Windows/macOS and only `gnome_libsecret`, `kwallet`, `kwallet5`, or `kwallet6` on Linux | Verified |
| Linux `basic_text` or unknown backend | Policy test proves `secure_storage_insecure`; provider credential operations fail closed | Verified by automated policy test |
| Unsupported platform or unavailable OS encryption | Policy test proves unavailable state; provider credential operations fail closed without plaintext fallback | Verified by automated policy test |
| Installed or distribution application packages | Not required for the `npm run dev` open-source development baseline | Out of scope |

The source checkpoint requires the real Electron lifecycle on the current development platform and deterministic automated policy coverage for the remaining platform/backend decisions. Release engineering may add installed-package acceptance later without reopening the source contract.
