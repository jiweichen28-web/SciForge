# SciForge · The Human Control Plane and Evidence Layer for Research Agents

<p align="center">
  <strong>As machines grow stronger, the interface grows thinner; human goals, judgment, and accountability remain.</strong>
</p>

<p align="center">
  Let mature agent runtimes execute in the background while researchers judge, correct, and approve at critical points—and preserve papers, data, tool calls, evidence, decisions, and artifacts as traceable research records.

## SciForge at a Glance

Future agents will automate an increasing share of research, but their work must still align with human goals, constraints, and judgment. SciForge preserves a GUI layer that will grow thinner as models improve, yet remain essential: humans set goals, inspect evidence, intervene at critical steps, and approve results; machines search, parse, execute, analyze, and generate.

| What SciForge provides | What you gain |
| --- | --- |
| **Intervention panel** | Review and correct plans, permissions, tool calls, file changes, evidence conflicts, and final releases at critical points. |
| **Research-state and evidence capture** | Automatically collect papers, scientific objects, command and tool results, figures, annotations, claims, provenance, and decision records. |
| **Scientific enhancement layer** | Extend general-purpose agents with scientific multimodal routing, literature search, Evidence / Project DAGs, controlled plotting, writing, presentation, and rerunnable workflows. |
| **Long-lived research workspace** | Keep research across sessions, roles, and tools resumable, reviewable, and transferable. |

SciForge does **not reinvent or replace** mature runtimes such as Codex and Claude Code. It works with them: runtimes provide general-purpose agent execution, while SciForge provides scientific objects, research context, human review interfaces, and evidence governance. **Codex is the default runtime; Claude Code can be selected explicitly in Settings.**

## Public Showcases

Four flagship examples show how SciForge closes the loop between agent execution, human PI intervention, and auditable research records:

| Showcase | Value in one sentence | Reviewable materials |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Multi-day Agentic Research Sprint** | A PI-controlled, long-horizon research loop for meiosis gene discovery, spanning 132 stages and 199+ Git commits. | [Public repository](https://github.com/AGI4Sci/scenario-01-research-sprint) |
| **AI-Guided Protein Design** | ProteinMPNN sequence design combined with Boltz-2 / ESMFold structural validation and explicit criteria for follow-up experiments. | [Public repository](https://github.com/kaiwinYao1/sciforge-de-novo-protein-demo) |
| **AI-Guided Molecular Optimization** | Traceable SAR iteration around an EGFR scaffold: 135 filtered candidates and 36 docking evaluations. | [Public repository](https://github.com/AGI4Sci/molclaw) |
| **Genome-to-BGC Discovery** | antiSMASH, MIBiG, BiG-SCAPE, and multi-agent analysis combined to prioritize 430 BGC regions with evidence. | [Public repository](https://github.com/wenne-kwj/scenario-bgc-genome-discovery) |

## What You Can Do

- **Read and review literature**: Search arXiv, bioRxiv, Europe PMC, and Semantic Scholar; parse PDFs; annotate pages; ask questions about selections; and write research content.
- **Understand scientific objects**: Send protein sequences, protein structures, small molecules, and single-cell expression data to specialized translators, then return auditable textual evidence to the main agent for reasoning.
- **Reproduce and experiment**: Let agents read and write files in real workspaces, run commands, connect to SSH / HPC or scientific tools, and preserve execution and change records.
- **Govern evidence and decisions**: Review individual sessions with Evidence DAG and manage goals, evidence, reviews, and release states across sessions with Project DAG.
- **Communicate research**: Generate controlled plots from data and reference figures, revise them in Canvas, then use them in papers, reports, and PPTX deliverables.
- **Automate and collaborate**: Turn repeated steps into Workflows or Schedules, and supervise long-running tasks through desktop, mobile, and team entry points.

SciForge is local-first by default; models, remote execution, and scientific expert services are configured explicitly by users or institutions. Nodes in Evidence / Project DAGs are reviewable **evidence candidates**, not automatically generated truth. Scientific conclusions still require domain-expert judgment, and computational results in the showcases do not constitute experimental validation.

> **How to read the showcases:** These are prototype demonstrations and public audit materials documented in the paper, not completed clinical/experimental validations or comprehensive benchmarks. The paper also records explicit limitations: the protein-design case contains a provenance mismatch; the run counts and selection rules in the MCFST reproduction still require revision; and the molecular-optimization case missed its preregistered primary metric and remained within docking noise. Treat them as reviewable research trajectories, not automatically generated scientific conclusions.

## Quick Start

### Install Directly

Download a macOS, Windows, or Linux installer from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/AGI4Sci/SciForge/releases). On first launch, choose a runtime in **Settings**, configure Model Router / provider, and select a local workspace for your new task.

### Run from Source

Requirements: Node.js 22.12+ and a locally installed, authenticated Codex (default) or Claude Code CLI.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AGI4Sci/SciForge.git
cd SciForge
npm install
npm run dev
```

Common validation commands:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run build
```

For complete instructions on installation, first-time setup, runtime selection, worker startup, scientific workflows, data locations, and troubleshooting, see the **[SciForge Usage Wiki](./docs/wiki/README.md)**.

### Mobile and cloud collaboration

The collaboration backend is part of this open-source repository rather than a hidden desktop service. The cloud server and PostgreSQL migrations live in [`packages/collaboration-server`](./packages/collaboration-server/), the Zulip provider in [`packages/collaboration-provider-zulip`](./packages/collaboration-provider-zulip/), the shared protocol in [`packages/collaboration-contracts`](./packages/collaboration-contracts/), and the desktop domain in [`packages/domains/collaboration`](./packages/domains/collaboration/).

The repository has one long-lived branch, `gui`. Desktop, cloud, and the current Zulip phone entrypoint are built and tested from the same exact commit instead of drifting per-client source branches. They still release independently: Electron installers contain the desktop application; ECS installs only the contracts, Zulip provider, and collaboration-server tarballs; phones currently use the official Zulip app. The future native client entrypoint is reserved at [`apps/mobile`](./apps/mobile/); it currently contains architecture and open-source reuse guidance, not installable code. Shared-contract changes run both desktop and cloud validation.

See the [server README](./packages/collaboration-server/README.md) for source builds, migrations, configuration, probes, and tests. Production systemd, Nginx, backup, upgrade, and rollback procedures are documented in the [Chinese operations guide](./docs/operations/zulip-aliyun-deployment.zh-CN.md). Passwords, API keys, private keys, and tokens must always be injected from deployment-managed secret files or a secret manager outside Git.
